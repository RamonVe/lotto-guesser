Test Future

This will be similar to the practice section, however, instead of picking past games.

Users will be able to pick the game and then decide on the date of the game.

Powerball = Monday, Wednesday and Saturday
Megamillion = Tuesday and Friday
Lotto = Wednesday and Saturday
Cash = everyday
TN cash = Monday, Wednesday and Friday

Once the future date has been selected and the game, the user will have the option to play for future numbers. The system will have a timer, recording the geomagnetic. At the end of session the user will put in their inputs and depending on the date of the future game, there will be a question asking if they were correct or not - this can be saved so the user can update this later if they were right or not.
